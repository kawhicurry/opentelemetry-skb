Trace the `struct sk_buff` with opentelemetry

# Introduction

`Opentelemetry-Skb` is a project that trace the parameter `struct sk_buff` in kernel function call with `ebpf`. And then xport the data through `openlemetry protocol`.

It's my bachelor's degree project. I'm trying to do something interesting with `ebpf`. Since I'm a newbie in this area, any advice is welcome.
